What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for automating the deployment and management of applications within containers. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package an application and all its dependencies, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments. Docker simplifies software deployment by ensuring applications run smoothly, regardless of the underlying infrastructure or operating system.

With Docker, you can package applications into containers that can be executed independently of their environment. This helps accelerate and standardize the development and deployment process of software.
What are the YAML files?

This repository contains various YAML files used for automating and managing Docker containers. These files are playbooks used in combination with Ansible or Docker Compose. They enable you to quickly configure and launch Docker containers, ensuring that you can run your applications in a repeatable and scalable manner.
Examples of YAML files in this repository:

    Docker Compose YAML files: These files define multiple Docker containers along with their networks, volumes, and configurations. They allow you to start complex applications with multiple container services.
    Ansible Playbooks: These YAML files are responsible for automating Docker installations and deploying containers on different hosts. They allow you to manage and configure Docker and containers across multiple machines.

Usage

To use the YAML files, you can either use Docker Compose or Ansible, depending on your needs:

    Docker Compose:
        Use the docker-compose.yml to define multiple containers and start them with a single command.
        Example: docker-compose up -d
